      <h1>Defining true love</h1>
      <p class="meta">Jan 27, 2026 · Essay</p>

      <p>True love is often described as a feeling, but here it's defined as a pattern of choices and practices that sustain a relationship over time — especially in hardship.</p>

      <h2>Five elements of true love</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Commitment to repair:</strong> After harm, both people try to repair — not to erase feelings, but to restore trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Empathic attention:</strong> A practice of listening to understand, not just to respond; making space for the other's inner life.</li>
        <li><strong>Mutual growth:</strong> The relationship supports each person's development rather than freezing them in old roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Generosity with boundaries:</strong> Being kind while keeping clear limits to protect safety and dignity.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared meaning:</strong> Creating rituals, stories, and projects that make difficult days feel part of a larger "we."
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Short practices to cultivate true love</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Repair script: own mistake → apology → ask how to make it right → agree a concrete step.</li>
        <li>Micro check-ins: 5-minute daily check to name one thing that went well and one thing that felt hard.</li>
        <li>Gratitude list: weekly ritual of sharing one small thing each person noticed about the other.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>True love isn't perfect feeling; it's reliable practice. If you'd like, try the repair script this week and report back — I'll share reflections from readers later.</p>
