      <h1>Staying together when things get hard</h1>
      <p class="meta">Jan 27, 2026 · Guide</p>

      <p>Difficult seasons — grief, job loss, illness, or conflict — test relationships. Staying together doesn't mean enduring harm; it means choosing repair, clarity, and care when possible. Below are practical strategies you can start using today.</p>

      <h2>1. Clear repair practices</h2>
      <p>When harm happens: pause, name the harm, take responsibility for your part, and ask the other what they need to feel safe. Agree on one small action to begin repair.</p>

      <h2>2. Create a "conflict contract"</h2>
      <p>Draft a few commitments for arguments: no name-calling, a 20-minute cool-down before continuing, and a promise to revisit within 24 hours. Put them somewhere visible.</p>

      <h2>3. Use micro-rituals to reconnect</h2>
      <p>Short, regular rituals — a shared cup of tea, a 5-minute evening check-in — lower the temperature and keep intimacy alive even during stress.</p>

      <h2>4. External support</h2>
      <p>Consider counseling or couples therapy as a resource, not a failure. Peers, mentors, or a trusted friend can help when you're stuck on repeating patterns.</p>

      <h2>5. Protect safety and boundaries</h2>
      <p>Staying together must never require tolerating abuse. If you or your partner feel unsafe, prioritize safety and seek help immediately.</p>

      <h2>6. Practical exercise: The Three-Question Pause</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>What am I feeling right now?</li>
        <li>What do I need most in this moment?</li>
        <li>What's one small, respectful thing I can ask my partner for?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Use the Three-Question Pause in conflict to move conversations from reactive to constructive.</p>

      <p>If you'd like this converted into a printable one-page "conflict contract" or a pocket-size checklist, say the word and I'll prepare a PDF you can download.</p>
